# The standard cost decay
#  1000 is the default for far away repositories, e.g. Fedora
#   500 is our https-based (https://)
#   100 is our nfs-based (file://)
#    10 is our local-based (file://)
#     9 is our mock rebuilt
#     1 is our infrastructure
#

# The repo is not signed & sealed (yet)
# The packages are not signed & sealed (yet)
# ... but we built these.
